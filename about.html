                        <h2>About Ocean's Eleven</h2>
                            <p>Ocean's Eleven was produced in 2001 with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts starring in the movie.<br/> This movie is about a group of eleven people who robbed a Casino. The Casino that they wanted to rob was Tess's (Julia Roberts) <br/> boyfriends casino. Danny (George Clooney) was suspected to only want to rob this casino to attempt to win Tess back. <br/> This crew of eleven must work effectively to do their part in the heist. Even the smallest mistake could cost them their whole operation. <br/> Each member of the crew played their parts impecibly. If you don't believe me, go watch for youself!</p>
