                        <h2>Reviews</h2>
                            <p>"Ocean's Eleven greatest strength is its emersion of the audience into the midst of a story already in motion. The pacing isn't weighed down by exposition; instead, the viewer discovers important history and surprises simultaneously as the characters on screen. The absolutely brilliant cast is effortlessly charming, whose antics and charisma fuel the movie to be a wonderful ride from start to finish. You can't help but feel welcomed into Danny Ocean's crew. With amazing acting, storytelling, clever twists, and exceptional directing, Ocean's Eleven is a must-see and my favorite movie of all time. As a young teen who stood firmly in the grunge camp of wearing ripped jeans and rock 'n' roll t-shirts, Ocean's Eleven convinced me that every now and then... suits are cool too." <i>-TC Mooney</i></p>

                            <p>"I don't understand people who rate this movie with four or fewer stars. I don't know what could be wrong with this realization. Apart from the extraordinary cast of actors, clever acting and outwitting of the opponents, bold remarks and nature of the characters, this film can only be rated with an A! Each character has their own personal gameplay, system that shows in a certain situation that everyone is different in their own way and shows that extraordinarily when needed. Adding certain details to characters like Rusty who constantly eats something or Linus who always looks insecure because he looks at the floor, tells you that the film was done with great care and that the actors themselves added something that is characteristic of their own character tells you enough about film. A very entertaining film that can be watched countless times, you don't need too much attention at every moment, but therefore every moment of the film is such that you have to be focused on the film. <br/> A real popcorn movie." <i>-Sonja Bakic</i></p>
